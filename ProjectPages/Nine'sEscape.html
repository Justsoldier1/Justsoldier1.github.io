                        A big focus within this project was to avoid any usage of casts. I wanted to avoid casts as these can be very expensive when it comes<br>
                        to memory usage, with it loading the actor it is connecting to into memory when it may not be necessary.<br>
                        <small>Memory usage difference between casting and interfaces:<br></small>
                        <image src="/Resources/Images/Casting and interfaceMemory.png" class="DropdownImage" Title="Image showing memory usage differences with casting, with casting using 0.6 more KiB per usage"></image><br>
                        This can be best seen within my BP_Button actor, which holds an array of actor references. This reference is as high level as possible,<br>
                        meaning that it can be expanded to work with any object that inherits from the actor class. Since these references are higher<br>
                        level, they do not load in the object stored directly, resulting in an decrease in memory usage. These references, when the button is<br>
                        activated, are then used as the actor reference for an interface, which will run a function inside of said actor's code without<br>
                        loading it into memory if it does not exist. An example of where I used this is within the door actor, which changes its opened state<br>
                        when the 'Enabled' interface function is called.<br><br>

                        Another focus within this project was to use the event-based programming pattern. This means that certain functions where only called<br>
                        when necessary in code, instead of using tick to check for a condition every frame. This leads to a boost in performance, with less<br>
                        redundant operations being completed.<br>
                        To keep to this pattern, I mainly used collisions, with either line traces or actual colliders triggering overlap events in actors.<br>
                        This can be seen in the push and pull mechanics, where capsule traces where used to apply a force onto game objects in front of the player.<br>

                    Within this project, components were used to make reusable code. Components are classes that can be added to any GameObject to add<br>
                    functionality. The component that was used the most was the ammo component. This was similar to a health component, with an integer<br>
                    that had a maximum and a minimum amount, that would be clamped to stop the integer exceeding these limits.<br>
